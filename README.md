# BRAWL-STARS-V11-BRAWLER-MAKER-TOOL
Answer some questions and get your brawler csvs ready!
# HOW TO RUN
- on android:

Install pydroid3 from playstore, and run main.py
- on windows:

Install python and run main.py
# How it works
Run main.py and answer the followed questions, and after questions are done, your brawler csvs will be in the csvs folder!
# REMARKS
- Making star powers isn't a feature yet, your brawler will use shelly star power to avoid menu crashing
- Using pet, item, or an area effect in an attack or ulti isn't a feature yet
- the tool supports creating only 1 brawler per the csvs that it offers, due to something called "sort order" in cards.csv, I'll try finding a way to make it supports more later
- adding your own skin isn't a feature, it will use shelly model for your brawler that can be changed by manually editing skins.csv
- do NOT add your own csvs in the csvs folder, this may result in a crash
